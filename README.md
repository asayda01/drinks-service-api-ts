Learning Material - Lab - API Lab 1



ðŸ§ªðŸ‘¾ Welcome to API Lab 1
In this lab, youâ€™ll use the ExpressJS library to create a Web API to serve back JSON
Responses based on a HTTP Request. You will be using a Test-Driven approach.
ExpressJS is an extremely popular Node-based JavaScript framework which acts as a
web server, allowing developers to create many different types of web application. In our
case, it will provide the basis for us to create an API.
We will also be using TypeScript for this project ðŸ¥³
